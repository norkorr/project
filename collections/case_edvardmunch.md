# Case: Letters to and from Edvard Munch

## About
The Munch Museum has in its manuscript collection approximately 3.000 letters and letter drafts written by Edvard Munch (1863&#x2013;1944) and some 5.800 letters addressed to him. Some correspondences and a selection of the family letters have been published in printed editions, but most letters had never been published before the museum began making them digitally available &#x2013; by transcribing, encoding and publishing them &#x2013; at the digital archive for Edvard Munch's Writings, [emunch.no](https://emunch.no/welcome.xhtml).
