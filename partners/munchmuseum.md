## About the collection
Edvard Munch bequeathed all his works of art to the City of Oslo. The Munch collection consisted of approx. 1 150 paintings, close to 18 000 prints depicting more than 700 different motifs, 7 700 drawings and watercolours as well as 13 sculptures. In addition there were nearly 500 printing plates, 2 240 books, notebooks, documents, photographs, art tools, accessories and pieces of furniture. Further works of art by Edvard Munch as well as his extensive collection of letters were bequeathed to the City of Oslo by his sister Inger Munch, and were added to the Munch collection when she died in 1952. Today the Munch Museum houses more than half of Edvard Munch's paintings and most of the print motifs.
