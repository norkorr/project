# Case: Letters to and from Ivar Kleiven and Kristian Prestgard

## About
The Local History Wiki, one of the websites of the National Library of Norway, has published 178 letters to and from Ivar Kleiven (1854-1934), a historian from Vågå in Oppland, and Kristian Prestgard (1866-1946), a journalist from Heidal in the same county. The collection of letters first appeared in print in "Heime og ute", edited by Gudmund Harildstad and Kristoffer Kruken and published by Novus forlag in 2017.

Kleiven and Prestgard met as students at Telemark Folkehøgskule 1885–86. As adults Kleiven lived in Vågå, whereas Prestgard in 1893 emigrated to the United States, where he edited the Norwegian language newspaper Decorah-Posten for nearly 50 years. The letters between Kleiven and Prestgard provide valuable information on issues, agents and networks within the Norwegian national democratic movement, political and cultural, with a special focus on the language question – the substitution of the predominating Danish-Norwegian by a more genuinely Norwegian written language (nynorsk).
